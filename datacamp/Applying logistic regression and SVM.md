# Linear Classifiers in Python

Chapter outline rubric: see below

Course: [Linear Classifiers in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/linear-classifiers-in-python)

Prerequisites to course:
* Python, at the level of Intermediate Python for Data Science
* scikit-learn, at the level of Supervised Learning with scikit-learn
* supervised learning, at the level of Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

## Chapter 1: Applying logistic regression and SVM
In this chapter you will learn the basics of applying logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs) to classification problems. You'll use the syntax from  a popular machine learning library for Python called scikit-learn to fit classification models to real data.

### Lesson 1: scikit-learn refresher
---
This lesson reviews the syntax for scikit-learn to achieve various supervised learning steps, ranging from loading data to model evaluation. It also emphasizes the approach required to avoid over-fitting.

#### Learning objectives
* The learner will be able to perform steps of supervised learning with KNN classifier, along with tunning it's hyper-parameter.
* The learner will have an understanding why just training error alone is a poor metric for the models ability to classify unseen data.
* The learner will be able to compare models by their individual testing accuracies.


### Lesson 2: Applying logistic regression and SVM
---
Firstly, this lesson will guide you to apply logistic regression and SVC classifiers on scikit-learn's built in datasets. Secondly it cautions us on the over-fitting risk we take when using a complex classifier.

#### Learning objectives
* The learner will be able to apply LogisticRegression and SVC with default hyper-parameters
* The learner will be able to identify when a model is under-fitting or over-fitting.

### Lesson 3: Linear classifiers
---
This lesson discuses what it means when a classifier is linear. It also reviews few key vocabulary that will be used in following chapters.

#### Learning objectives

* The learner will able to identify if a decision boundary is linear.
* The learner will be able to visualize decision boundaries for 2 dimensional datasets.
