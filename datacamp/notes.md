Please submit a complete outline for chapter 1 of the course you have chosen from our wishlist.
Please provide
the title of each chapter,
the title of each lesson, and
a brief description of each lesson's contents including a learning objective for each lesson.

Please use the sample outline as a template to guide you in your submission.



----step 3 ----

Now, use the chapter outline you created in the previous section to help you list the practice exercises you will build to help learners practice the same materials they learned in the corresponding chapter.

Please make sure to:
1. Refer to the sample practice outline here for reference:  http://bit.ly/2RvmGei
2. Include 7 to 10 exercises covering the learning objectives in this chapter.
3. Only make exercises on the topics covered in the specified chapter, not on any other aspect (e.g. you can assume they understand all programming aspects not covered in the course).
4. Choose from the following 3 different types of exercises: MultipleChoiceChallenge, BlanksChallenge, and OutputChallenge (which allows selecting the code to match the output or select the output to match the code).
5. Make sure to have a good mix of different exercise types.
Submit an outline of the corresponding practice exercises you would create for your chapter using the guidelines above. Please refer to the sample practice outline here for guidance: http://bit.ly/2RvmGei *
Finally, create 3 sample exercises from your practice outline. You may include images and tables if you choose. Use this guide as a reference: http://bit.ly/2VtVFaj *
--- step 4 ----
Are the learning objectives concise?
Do you cover only the learning objectives relevant to this course?
Learning objectives of prerequisite courses should not be tackled in the Practice set of this course.
To understand what topics are covered in prerequisite courses, check the corresponding course page at datacamp.com.  You’ll find the course prerequisites on the dedicated course page, at the bottom of the right sidebar.
Are the learning objectives testable? Rather than writing "Student will understand X," a good learning objective should specify what the student will do to demonstrate what they know.
Are the learning objectives should be specific? If the objectives aren't clear to you, then they really won't be to the students.
